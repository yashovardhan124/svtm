        <h1>civil dept</h1>
      <p>The Civil Engineering Department, was started in 2010 with the intial intake of 90. Over the years, the department has produced young bright civil engineers of our country. The department has expertise in almost entire spectrum of civil engineering, apart from programmes specialized in Structural Engineering, Transportation Engineering and Infrastructure Systems</p>
        
        <p>Civil Engineering is the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man, as the means of production and of traffic in states, both for external and internal trade, as applied in the construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation and docks for internal intercourse navigation by artificial power for the purposes of commerce, and in the construction and application of machinery, and in the drainage of cities and towns</p>
