        <h1>welcome</h1>
        The department of Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) was established in the year 2006. The ECE Department has well qualified and highly experienced faculty members with areas of specialization that include Embedded Systems, Applied Electronics, Digital Systems, Communication Systems, Signal Processing and VLSI design. The Department is well-equipped with laboratories which cater to program needs Adequate numbers of computers with required software and EDA tools are available<br/>
        
        ECE Department aims at producing engineers who are competent to cope with the emerging technological advances. Every year many students get admitted in some of the most reputed institutions in India and Abroad. The department has been imparting excellent training to the students leading to their securing top ranks in the University Examinations and in competetitive examinations like GATE, Engg. Services etc.,<br/>
